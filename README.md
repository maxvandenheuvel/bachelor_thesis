The code for the thesis concerning an implementation of existing conversion algorithms between constraint-based and 
priority-based rule base representations, 
by means of the Quine-McCluskey Boolean simplification algorithm.
Exploiting this conversion, this work proposes a method for computing the priority 
determination for the rules in given rule bases.

Install ANTLR:
https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/python-target.md


Change the text file according to the rule base grammar.

Change the main file to choose the conversion algorithm and convert the rule bases.

Run: python3 main.py

to convert the given rule base into constraint-based representation,
as mention in the paper.
